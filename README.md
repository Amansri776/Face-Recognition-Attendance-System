# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
The Image-Based Attendance System developed in this project aims to leverage facial recognition technology to automate the attendance process. This system captures the image of individuals, processes the image to detect and recognize faces, and subsequently marks the attendance based on successful identification.
This approach addresses many of the limitations associated with traditional attendance methods:
•	It eliminates the possibility of proxy attendance, ensuring authenticity.
•	It reduces manual workload and the time taken to record attendance.
•	It ensures real-time recording and easy generation of reports.
•	It increases transparency and accountability.
